            <h2>New Year</h2>
            <p>Another year has arrived, an incremental array of numbers that brings with it new experiences and changes that represent my advancement.</p>
            <p>I am determined to carry on with my projects and perhaps even create some new ones.</p>
            <h2>The Blog</h2>
            <p>And yes, apparently I have started to archive my thoughts and experiences monthly on a web page kindly hosted by my friend github pages... (: ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
            <p>The idea would be to continue using this blog primarily as a personal and constructive matter toward me having a place to think and save my thoughts.ü§î</p>
