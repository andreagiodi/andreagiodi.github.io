            <h2>New Year</h2>
            <p>Another year has arrived, an incremental array of numbers that brings with it new experiences and changes that represent my advancement.</p>
            <p>I am determined to carry on with my projects and perhaps even create some new ones.</p>
            <h2>The Blog</h2>
            <p>And yes, apparently I have started to archive my thoughts and experiences monthly on a web page kindly hosted by my friend github pages... (: ❤️</p>
            <p>The idea would be to continue using this blog primarily as a personal and constructive matter toward me having a place to think and save my thoughts.🤔</p>
            <h2>My Birthday</h2>
            <p>Jan. 27, my 19th birthday, I feel no particular change other than the constant pressures of school and the upcoming college entrance tests. Let's just say it's an eventful time, I'm constantly thinking and giving it my all (at least I think so) for this school year.💭</p>
            <h2>The Project</h2>
            <p>Leaving aside these evil thoughts, I am focusing on a new project, a project which is pushing me to devote all my free time to it after school studies, I really think it is worth it, I like it.🙂</p>
